# KTaNE Notepad

KTaNE Notepad (KNP) is an experimental website for the game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/)
that tries to offer a balance between the original bomb manual, ["optimized" manuals,](https://github.com/michalmatlega/ktane-pocket-manual)
and programs that [can be considered cheating.](https://github.com/ggtylerr/KAaNE-AE-)
